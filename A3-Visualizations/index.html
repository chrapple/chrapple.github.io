      <h2>Visualization 1: Global sales by genre and platform</h2>
      <p> I made a circle chart mapping Platform to x-axis and Genre to y-axis.
        Circles are larger and darker with the more Global Sales they had.
        This helped my goal of being able to quickly scan for the most important (in this case, high-selling) information.
        I learned that Sports games sold the most on PS2 and Wii, Shooter games on Xbox 360, and Action games on PS3.
        Action games seemed to dominate many platforms at once judging by the larger and dark circles, unlike Shooter that dominate on one.
      </p>
      <div id="vis1"></div>
      <h2>Visualization 2: Sales over time by platform and genre</h2>
      <p> I made two line charts mapping Year to x-axis and Global Sales to y-axis.
        Each genre and platform I analyzed was assigned a different line colour and shape combination to identify them.
        I learned that there was a likely connection between the peak of Sports game sales and the peak of Wii game sales in 2009, likely due to Wii Sports.
        I also discovered that PS2 games had a huge peak in 1998, but no specific genre rose along with it so it was likely that the games were a mixed bag of genres.
      </p>
      <div id="vis2"></div>
      <div id="vis3"></div>
      <h2>Visualization 3: Regional sales vs. platform</h2>
      <p> I made a chart of ticks mapping Platform to x-axis and Global Sales to y-axis.
        I created conditional statements that assigned a tick to a specific colour if it had the most sales in JP, NA, EU or other.
        This way I could get a quick glance at the cluster of colours to determine which region had the top sales.
        I learned that games on the SNES and NES had more JP sales, while games on the GameCube and 2600 had more NA Sales.
        I was surprised to see the PS4 showing a lot of green (EU Sales).
        Other region sales didn't dominate a specific platform but had a couple games lying around like GTA: San Andreas and Gran Turismo 4.
      </p>
      <div id="vis4"></div>
      <h2>Visualization 4: Visual story of RPG game sales between NA and JP</h2>
      <p> I made a chart of points mapping JP Sales to x-axis and NA Sales to y-axis.
        I created conditional statements that assigned games with higher JP Sales red and higher NA Sales blue.
        I was interested in this topic because I like JRPGs. 
        I was surprised to learn that the Pokemon performed extremely well in both regions.
        There were quite a lot of games that made a diagonal between JP and NA sales, meaning they sold relatively similarly in each region.
        I learned also that game series like Monster Hunter and Dragon Quest were only popular in Japan while games like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls were only popular in NA.
