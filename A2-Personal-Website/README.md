This is a personal website created for IAT355.

The site was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I wrote the code using Visual Studio Code.

Starting from the homepage, the navigation on the top right allows to switch between information about myself to the visualizations I made for this assignment.
The homepage has a short introduction about myself in a divider, a short list of skills, and lastly a header at the bottom with my contacts.
The bunny image is a sprite I created for a video game I made in IAT265 and is clickable here.

On the visualizations page, I created a bar chart in JavaScript with randomized values. Therefore, the lengths of each bar changes on each refresh. You can get clued in on this interaction by clicking on a bar.
Beneath it is my drawing of the character Chiikawa created in JavaScript. If you click on the mouth, it changes colour.
